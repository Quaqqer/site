    <h4>This website</h4>
    I created this website using the Flask framework for Python. I host it on my
    virtual private server that I rent from Hetzner, a German company.<br><br>

    <h4>Advent of Code</h4>
    For the past three years I have participated in Advent of Code, since a
    student association in my university hosts a competition every year. The
    first year I did not quite complete the entire year but the last two years
    (2020 and 2021) I have come second place in the student associations
    leaderboard out of roughly 50 respectively 80 participants.

    <h4>Snake written in Rust</h4>
    This was just a simple project I did because I wanted to do something
    relatively fun. The game is of course very simple but I had fun both
    applying my knowledge of rust as well as learning the terminal interface
    library ncurses.<br><br>
